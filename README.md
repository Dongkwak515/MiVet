# MiVet
Mi Vet is a mobile and web-application focused on improving the lives of equine veterinarians and the beautiful animals that count on them.

Mi Vet is a MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide snippets of my code.

This repository contains the SQL, .NET, and React code for the donate page i created for the app.
